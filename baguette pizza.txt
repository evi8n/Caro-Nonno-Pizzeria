Ingredients
1 French baguette

1/2 cup pizza sauce, or as needed

2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

2 ounces cooked and crumbled sausage

2 ounces mini pepperoni slices

Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Split baguette in half lengthwise. Warm pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl until hot, about  45 seconds.

Spread pizza sauce on baguette, sprinkle on cheese, and scatter sausage and pepperoni on top as desired. Place pizza onto a baking tray.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 18 minutes. Optional step: turn on the oven’s broiler, set a rack 6 inches below the heating element, and broil the pizza for a deeper color, 1 to 2 minutes.

Cut pizza crosswise into slices. Serve and enjoy.

Chef's Note:
If you prefer, cut 16 crosswise slices of bread. Each slice can be a “round mini pizza”
which can then be customized for each person’s preference.
